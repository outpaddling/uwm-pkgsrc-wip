This is a collection of work-in-progress pkgsrc packages developed by
the research computing support group at the University of Wisconsin
Milwaukee.

THIS COLLECTION IS DEPRECATED.  IT WAS CREATED MAINLY TO WORK AROUND
SOURCEFORGE RELIABILITY ISSUES WHEN THE OFFICIAL PKGSRC WIP COLLECTION
WAS HOSTED THERE.  NOW THAT PKGSRC WIP IS RELIABLY SELF-HOSTED, THIS
COLLECTION IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED.

It supplements the global pkgsrc-wip project:

    https://pkgsrc.org/wip/

Most of these packages will be moved to pkgsrc-wip eventually.

Packages exist here for one of a few reasons:

1.  To experiment with variations of packages in pkgsrc-wip

2.  To allow development and testing on hosts not registered to commit
    to pkgsrc-wip

3.  We just haven't gotten around to moving them to pkgsrc-wip yet.


To use these packages:

1.  cd prefix/pkgsrc[-suffix]

2.  svn co https://[username@]github.com/outpaddling/uwm-pkgsrc-wip/trunk \
	uwm-pkgsrc-wip

    or

    git clone https://[username@]github.com/outpaddling/uwm-pkgsrc-wip \
	uwm-pkgsrc-wip
