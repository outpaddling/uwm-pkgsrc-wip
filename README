This is a collection of work-in-progress pkgsrc packages developed by
the research computing support group at the University of Wisconsin
Milwaukee.

It supplements the global pkgsrc-wip project:

    https://pkgsrc.org/wip/

Most of these packages will be moved to pkgsrc-wip eventually.

Packages exist here for one of a few reasons:

1.  To experiment with variations of packages in pkgsrc-wip

2.  To allow development and testing on hosts not registered to commit
    to pkgsrc-wip

3.  We just haven't gotten around to moving them to pkgsrc-wip yet.
