Check both the committed and wip versions of each port listed below and
verify that it needs to be implemented or upgraded.

The one problem a version control system doesn't mitigate is duplicated
effort, so keep the rest of us informed about what you're working on.

Send us an email before beginning new work and if taking over
work on someone else's package, set MAINTAINER to your email.

Lastly, commit early, commit often, so everyone has access to the latest.
