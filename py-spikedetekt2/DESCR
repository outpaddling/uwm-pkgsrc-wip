The KlustaSuite is an open source spike sorting software suite designed for
extracellular recordings obtained with large multielelectrode arrays (with
hundreds of channels).

The KlustaSuite contains three programs:

SpikeDetekt for detecting and extracting spikes from raw recordings
(written in Python).

KlustaKwik for automatically clustering the detected spikes (written in C++).

KlustaViewa for manually processing the results of the automatic step
(written in Python).
