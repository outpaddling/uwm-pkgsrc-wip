Exact version needed:
	DEPENDS+=	pkgname-version{,nb*}
	Allows for revisions

PKGNAME should match directory name

Document any deviations from the ideal, such as

-   Using USE_GCC, CXXFLAGS+=-std=g++11, etc.

-   Reasons not to run the latest release

    Something depends on an older release
    There are unacceptable known bugs with the latest

-   DEPENDS use pkg-[0-9]* rather than pkg>=0

Avoid using continuations for the sake of greps, e.g.
    DEPENDS=    a \
		b
    
    should be
    
    DEPENDS=    a
    DEPENDS+=   b
    
Python:

    Is egg.mk if it works.  Then try distutils.mk, then extension.mk.

    Set EGG_NAME to packagename-version AS INSTALLED by py setuptools if
    different from DISTNAME.
